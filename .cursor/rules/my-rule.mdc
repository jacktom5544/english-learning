# Your rule content

-Guide Line
Make sure the project works in both in local and production(AWS Amplify)
Poduction url is https://main.d2gwwh0jouqtnx.amplifyapp.com/
Don't expose API keys to public
The production site is already in AWS Amplify
Next.js 15.2.2(latest Version) with App Router
TypeScript with strict typing
MongoDB for database
For Subscription, use Stripe 
Database Name is english-learning(alreday created)
Tailwind CSS
Make modern looking website
Cloudinary for image storage
Recharts for graph/charts
The website should be fully Responsive(PC, Tablet and Smartphone)
Since this service is for Japanese, UI should be in Japanese
Use Deepseek chat for AI generate contents
Make sure the code you generate is secure and follows the best practice
Make Re-usable component as much as possible(Don't scatter similar codes everywhere)
Don't edit content of .env.local

-Important 
The native MongoDB driver proved more stable than Mongoose in the Amplify serverless environment for the refactored routes. So, always use native MongoDB driver.
